# Characteristic Impedance
<Author fm={frontMatter}></Author>

Consider a wave on a string which is described by a solution to the 1D Wave Equation $\frac{\partial^2y}{\partial x^2}= \frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial^2y}{\partial t^2}$ (where c is the wave speed).
The driven end of the string at $x=0$ will create a sinusoidal wave  and for this wave to be continuously sinusoidal the applied force should balance the transverse component of the tension
in the string, in this case in the y direction.

Using the small angle approximation the transverse component of the tension is approximately $-T\tan(\theta)$ which using fundamental trigonometry is equivalent to $-T\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}|_{x=0}$.
Finally by substituting the wave equation we can write the transverse force required in terms of the transverse velocity as:

$$F_t=\frac{T}{c}\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \equiv\sqrt{T\rho} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}$$

Where $\rho$ is the linear density of the string we define characteristic impedance $Z=\sqrt{T\rho}$  as a measure of the resistance to sinusoidal motion in the string, which in
lossless media will be determined by the inertia and elasticity of the string.
